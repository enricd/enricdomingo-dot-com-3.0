                ðŸ‘‹ I'm Enric and I'm from Barcelona. I'm currently working at ERNI in a Boehringer Ingelheim's pharma 
                project as a Senior ML and Software Engineer. I'm also a Technical Coach and the Lead of the Data and AI Community at ERNI.

                I studied 60% of the Aerospace Engineering degree and co-founded Venturi Unmanned 
                Technologies during that time, a startup designing, building and operating VTOL drones for 
                long range industrial inspections. During those years, I started learning more about software   
                and AI, and later I switched my studies to the Computer Engineering degree while learning more 
                about Machine Learning and MLOps by my own.
