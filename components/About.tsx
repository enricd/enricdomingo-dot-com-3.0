                ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m Enric and I&apos;m from Barcelona. I&apos;m currently working as a Senior ML and Software Engineer at ERNI 
                in a Boehringer Ingelheim&apos;s pharma project. I&apos;m also a Technical Coach and the Lead of the Data and AI Community at ERNI.

                I studied 60% of the Aerospace Engineering degree and co-founded Venturi Unmanned 
                Technologies during that time, a startup designing, building and operating VTOL drones for 
                long range industrial inspections. During those years, I started learning more about software   
                and AI, and later I switched my studies to the online Computer Engineering degree (currently part time finishing 
                the 3rd year) while learning more about Machine Learning, MLOps and Bioinformatics by my own.
